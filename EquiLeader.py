'''
 non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.

An equi leader is an index S such that 0 ≤ S < N − 1 and two sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N − 1] have leaders of the same value.

For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 2

we can find two equi leaders:

        0, because sequences: (4) and (3, 4, 4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
        2, because sequences: (4, 3, 4) and (4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.

The goal is to count the number of equi leaders.

Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of equi leaders.

For example, given:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 3
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 4
    A[4] = 4
    A[5] = 2

the function should return 2, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000].

def solution(A):
    N = len(A)

    # Find the leader of the whole array (if it exists)
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    for value in A:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = value
            count += 1
        else:
            if candidate == value:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1

    # Check if the candidate is the leader
    count_candidate = A.count(candidate)
    if count_candidate <= N // 2:
        return 0  # No leader, so no equi leaders

    leader = candidate

    equi_leader_count = 0
    leader_count_left = 0
    leader_count_right = count_candidate

    for i in range(N - 1):
        if A[i] == leader:
            leader_count_left += 1
            leader_count_right -= 1

        if leader_count_left > (i + 1) // 2 and leader_count_right > (N - i - 1) // 2:
            equi_leader_count += 1

    return equi_leader_count
