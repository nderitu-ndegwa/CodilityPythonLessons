'''
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] (0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).

For example, array A such that:
  A[0] = -3
  A[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2
  A[3] = -2
  A[4] = 5
  A[5] = 6

contains the following example triplets:

        (0, 1, 2), product is −3 * 1 * 2 = −6
        (1, 2, 4), product is 1 * 2 * 5 = 10
        (2, 4, 5), product is 2 * 5 * 6 = 60

Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.

Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty array A, returns the value of the maximal product of any triplet.
'''

def solution(A):
    A.sort()
    n = len(A)
    max_product = A[n-1] * A[n-2] * A[n-3]
    temp_product = A[0] * A[1] * A[n-1]
    if temp_product > max_product:
        max_product = temp_product
    return max_product
